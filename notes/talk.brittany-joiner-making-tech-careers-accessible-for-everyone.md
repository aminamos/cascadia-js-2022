## Abstract

If you didn't 'grow up' coding or study comp sci at uni, you might have never considered a technical job. Yet it's totally possible for people midway through their non-technical career to become a developer. But why aren't more people doing it? I go through my journey from marketer to developer and explain the things that helped and hindered me. You'll learn why more folks don't do it and specific things we can all do to change that!

## Notes by [aminamos](https://github.com/aminamos)
- many people don't have a linear path from compsci undergrad to software career
- meet underrepresented groups where they are
    - most of these groups are in caretaking roles
- "fresh perspectives" means from another company or industry, but different roles creates cognitive diversity
- roadblocks
    - exposure is an issue/blocker, technical stuff provided to boys more often than girls - ask them if they care
    - not seeing people in the role is a blocker
    - be loud about who you are (if you feel comfortable/safe doing so)
    - limited view of engineering, what it is, lots of types of roles that don't involve writing code all day
- hiring managers - think outside the toolbox, screen for other skills and teach technical stuff later
- don't be sexist or comment on people's ability based on how they look, gender, etc
- most bootcamps are still inaccessible
    - altcademy - promotes more low cost courses and bootcmaps
    - (personal note: I usually recommend odin project because it's 100% free https://www.theodinproject.com/ and the various roadmaps for guidance https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)
- "just start coding and google when you get stuck"
    - this is bad advice
- hard to work all day then code in the evening
- lacking supportive company/job environment
    - not everyone can transition within the company
    - Zapier and Adidas actively work to develop their employees, split time roles to eventually switch to a more technical role
- getting stuck and feeling like you're the only person that gets stuck
- create slack channel called "learn-to-code" and share resources, help people understand tech is more than building apps
- if you got to tech on the traditional path, show your mistakes and don't be a tech evangelist(?)
- if you're from the non-traditional path
