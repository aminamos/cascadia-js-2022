- twitter has an engagement farming problem, long tweet threads with no real substance
- instagram has a culture incompatible with the genuine openness that can happen on tiktok
- reddit is anonymous, which makes it easier to make hate content
- youtube shorts has the benefit of being video native, but formality is the enemy of authenticity
